Ladies and Gentlemen! I am glad to present you my real project, after a lot of learning and suffering with HTML, CSS and my favorite (no) JavaScript!
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that a large amount of stylization, or rather animation, was used in this project. The Figma constructor helped me a lot, where with the help of it I could set the exact location of the object and its child or neighboring elements. I have been working on this project for a long time. So I hope you enjoy it too! :)
